A random collection of small projects

## TODO:
- discrete-lqr
    - Update all demos to work with partial sim refactor
    - Add discrete functionality to sim
- Short Tasks:
    - Create controllers module
        - Move proportionalFeedbackController from lqrUtils to controllers
        - Add integral controller from integralLqrControl demo.
        - Create/move tests
- Tasks:
    - Create jaxUtils module
        - Add interp, and any other useful jax functions.
    - Add discrete LQR (for all of the above?)
    - Add iterative LQR demo
    - Write quadcopter animation
- Simulator:
    - Add support for discrete controllers?
    - Add support for multi-rate systems
    - Generalize simBlocks + add signal map
    - Add support for output memory (can implement as a discrete memory block once above points are addressed)
    - Consider diffrax for ode integration?
- PlottingTools
    - Add support for structured arrays, can auto-extract names
    - Rename plotTrajectory to plotTrajectorySubplots
    - Add plotTrajectorySingleAx (plots multiple signals on one axis)
    - Add plot positionTrajectory (or generic phase plot?)
- Quadcopter:
    - Consider structured arrays (or something similar) to clean up state interface
        - Can then also update other tools to work with structured arrays
    - Consider [optimistix](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix) for trim
    - Add rotor dynamics
        - Add min/max rpm
    - Add rigid-body / rotor dynamics cross-coupling
        - eg. gyro moments,
    - Add generic dynamics function with options
        - Include inertial dynamics
        - Include rotor dynamics
- Project Config
    - Look into replacing flake8+yapf with ruff
    - Document flake8 ignore list
